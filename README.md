# Linux Scripts
Here you will find a small collection of linux scripts that can make certain things easier.

### Active Gateway

Note:
If there is something like place_your_variable_here in the script,
should be replaced by the relative variable to which it refers.

e.g.
curl -s -F "token=place_your_app_token_here" should be something like
curl -s -F "token=a1bkaj1a4yuex7n1etyhjbv90a2tbn"
```
